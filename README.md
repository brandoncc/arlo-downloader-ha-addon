# Arlo Downloader Home Assistant Add-on

A Home Assistant add-on wrapper around [arlo-downloader](https://github.com/diaznet/arlo-downloader) by [Jeremy Diaz](https://github.com/diaznet). All credit for the downloader itself goes to the original author.

This add-on packages arlo-downloader for easy installation and configuration through the Home Assistant UI, writing recordings to HA network storage (e.g., NFS) for long-term archival.

## Installation

### 1. Configure network storage

Go to Settings > System > Storage > Add Network Storage and configure your NFS or CIFS share:

- **Usage: Must be "Media"** — the add-on accesses storage via `/media/`, which is only available for Media-type mounts. Backup and Share mounts are not accessible.
- **Name:** Choose a name (e.g., `arlo`). This becomes the folder name under `/media/`.
- **Server:** Your NFS/CIFS server IP or hostname.
- **Remote share path:** The full export path on the server (e.g., `/var/nfs/shared/arlo`).

Once connected, your storage is available inside the add-on at `/media/<name>/`.

### 2. Install the add-on

1. In HA: Settings > Add-ons > Add-on Store > three-dot menu > Repositories
2. Add repository URL: `https://github.com/brandoncc/arlo-downloader-ha-addon`
3. Find "Arlo Downloader" in the store and click Install

### 3. Configure and start

1. Set your Arlo credentials and TFA settings
2. Set **media_directory** to the base path where recordings should be saved (e.g., `/media/arlo/videos`)
3. Set **filename_format** to control how files are organized within that directory (see below)
4. Start the add-on and enable "Start on boot" and "Watchdog"

## Configuration

### media_directory

The base path where recordings are saved. This should point to your network storage mount under `/media/`.

Example: `/media/arlo/videos`

### filename_format

Controls the directory structure and filenames within `media_directory`. The default organizes files by date and camera name:

`$Y/$m/$d/$NN/${F}T${t}_${N}_${SN}`

See [pyaarlo's saving media documentation](https://github.com/twrecked/pyaarlo#saving-media) for the full list of available format variables.
